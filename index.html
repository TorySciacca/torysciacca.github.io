<h1>The D30 System</h1>

<p></p>

<p class = "one">A tabletop rpg system designed to be mechanically simple but narratively rich. 1 30 sided dice and 30 rules.</p>

<p class = "two">This game is designed as a striped back tabletop role playing game. It is intended for beginners with little to no experience with these types of games. The focus is on role playing and having an enjoyable time. Rather than have to cram books worth of knowledge on the minutiae of lore and game mechanics. The real complexity comes through the narrative, nuances of play and creativity of the players. </p>
